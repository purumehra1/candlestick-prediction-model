üìà Candlestick Pattern Predictor
A deep learning system that predicts stock price movements using candlestick patterns and technical indicators. Built with TensorFlow and a hybrid CNN-LSTM neural network architecture.

üéØ Overview
This project implements a sophisticated machine learning model that analyzes historical stock market data to predict whether prices will move UP or DOWN. It combines Convolutional Neural Networks (for pattern recognition) with Long Short-Term Memory networks (for time-series analysis) to identify tradeable patterns in financial data.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Stock Selection - Analyze any stock with real-time data fetching via Yahoo Finance API

Advanced Feature Engineering - Automatically calculates 22+ technical indicators including:

Moving Averages (SMA 5, 10, 20, 50, 200 & EMA 12, 26)

Momentum Indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator)

Volatility Measures (Bollinger Bands, ATR)

Volume Analysis (OBV, Volume Rate of Change)

5 Major Candlestick Patterns (Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star, Bullish/Bearish Engulfing)

Hybrid CNN-LSTM Architecture - State-of-the-art deep learning model for sequential pattern recognition

Model Evaluation - Comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Persistence - Saves trained models for future predictions without retraining

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow/Keras - Deep learning framework

Scikit-learn - Data preprocessing and evaluation

Pandas & NumPy - Data manipulation

yfinance - Stock market data retrieval

TA-Lib - Technical analysis indicators

üß† Model Architecture
Input Layer - 20 timesteps √ó 22 features

Conv1D Layer - 64 filters, kernel size 3, ReLU activation

MaxPooling1D - Pool size 2

LSTM Layer - 50 units

Dropout - 0.2 for regularization

Dense Output - Sigmoid activation for binary classification

The model uses:

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Training: 50 epochs with early stopping and learning rate reduction

Data Split: 80% training, 20% testing

üìä Results
The model achieves prediction accuracy ranging from 55-85% depending on the stock and market conditions. Performance varies because:

Stock markets are inherently unpredictable

Short-term price movements contain significant noise

External factors (news, earnings, geopolitics) aren't included in the model

üéì What I Learned
Integrating Python with Xcode using External Build System

Time-series forecasting with deep learning

Financial feature engineering and technical analysis

Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

Real-world machine learning limitations in financial markets

üîÆ Future Improvements
 Add sentiment analysis from news/social media

 Implement multi-step ahead predictions

 Include volume-weighted indicators

 Add portfolio backtesting functionality

 Create visualization dashboard for predictions

 Support for cryptocurrency markets
